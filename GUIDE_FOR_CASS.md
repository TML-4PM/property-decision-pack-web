## 🎯 Key Options Explained

| Option | What It Means | Risk |
|--------|---------------|------|
| **A** | Keep both houses, do nothing | High |
| **B2** ⭐ | Sell Pen, keep 12-month buffer | Low-Medium |
| **D1** | Sell Seabrook, keep Pen debt-free | Very Low |
| **E1** | Sell both, rent while deciding | Flexible |

**B2 is recommended** because it:
- Cuts debt in half
- Keeps us in Seabrook
- Gives ~$130k safety buffer
- Protects your equity via credit mechanism

## 💰 Split Scenarios

If we sell both, there are 6 different ways to split shown under **"Splits"**:
- 50/50 equal
- 70/30 to you
- Each keeps their own property's net
- And more...

## ⚠️ Important Note

This is **modelling only** - not financial advice. The numbers help us think through options together. Final decisions should involve proper professional advice.
